*Author: Drake*

Environment: **game_2048.py**<br>
if you'd like to test(play) the game please try: **play_human.py**<br>(just use keyboard 'u','d','l','r' for up, down, left, right operation)<br>
DQN: **RL_brain.py**<br>
train the network: **train_AI.py**<br>
test the pretrained model: **play_ai.py**<br>Better than inital model but *Saddly, my trained model didn't play very well...(500 epochs, 32 batch/epoch)*<br>
